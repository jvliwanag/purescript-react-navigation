# Purescript React Navigation

Still a work in progress. See [HelloNav example](https://github.com/jvliwanag/purescript-react-navigation/blob/master/examples/HelloNav/src/React/Navigation/Examples/HelloNav.purs).

# Feature

  * Route Paramters are typed
  * Navigation to defined routes guaranteed at compile time.

# Planned

* Safe Back
  * Compile time check that back can only be performed if there is a page prior
* Complete the rest of the API
